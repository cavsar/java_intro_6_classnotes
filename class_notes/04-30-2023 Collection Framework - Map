How to compare collections?
What are the differences between ____ and ____?
	- insertion order (ordered or unoredered)
	- allowing duplication or not
	- allowing null elements or not
	- sorting or not
	- memory (way of storing elements)
	- performance
	- synchronized or not
	- family-tree (parent classes and interfaces)


List: ArrayList, LinkedList, Vector 
	- keeps insertion order
	- allows duplicates
	- allows multiple null elements


Set: HashSet, LinkedHashSet, TreeSet
	- does not keep insertion order
	- does not allow duplicates (unique elements only)
	- allows only 1 null element




Map: HashMap, LinkedHashMap, TreeMap, Hashtable
	-it stores data as key-value pairs
	-Keys are always unique - one null (Set)
	-Keys can be considered as identifiers
	-Values can be duplicate - multiple null values (List)
	-No insertion order - no methods with indexes


LinkedHashMap
	-it stores data as key-value pairs
	-Keys are always unique - one null (LinkedHashSet)
	-Keys can be considered as identifiers
	-Values can be duplicate - multiple null values (List)
	-It keeps insertion order - no methods with indexes


TreeMap
	-it stores data as key-value pairs
	-No insertion order - no methods with indexes
	-It keeps key-value pairs sorted based on keys
	-Keys are always unique - NO null key (TreeSet)
	-Keys can be considered as identifiers
	-Values can be duplicate - multiple null values (List)


NOTE: Hashtable is synchronized (thread-safe) HashMap. 
Hashtable is slower but safer compared to HashMap when you will use multiple threads.
Hashtable does not allow any null keys or values. No null et all.
