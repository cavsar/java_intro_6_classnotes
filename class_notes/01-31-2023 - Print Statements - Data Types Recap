Println vs Print

Why do we use Println over Print?
Println - With Println we get a new line
    System.out.println("Hello World"); // \n escape sequence is implicit

    Output:
    Hello World
    <- With the println, the cursor ends here

Print - It will print whatever is output in System.out.print without any spaces or new lines
    System.out.print("Hello World");
    System.out.print("Hello" + " World"); // HelloWorld

    Output:
    Hello World<- With the print, the cursor ends here

Single line comments: // Your comment goes here

Multi-line comments:
    /*
        Your comments go in here
    */

Documentation comments: (highlights text in green, to make it easier for people to read what your code does)
    /**
    *
    */

If we have a really long statement to print, we can use '+' to newline the statement to fit better.

    System.out.println("gadfadfasaasssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss" +
        "sssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss" +
        "ssssssssssss"

Escape Sequences

    \t -> Gives a tab
    \n -> Gives a new line
    \\ -> Prints a single \
    \' -> Prints a single '
    \" -> Prints a single "

    System.out.println("Hello World" + "\t" + "My name is " + "\n" + "\"Jonathan\"");

    Output:
    Hello World    My name is
    "Jonathan"


Primitives

    int, short, byte, long, double, float, char, boolean

    boolean is used for true or false, 1 bit size. 0 = false, 1 = true

    char is used for a single character.
    char uses single quotations for the value. ex. 'A'
    char myFavoriteLetter = 'A';

    int myAge = 20;
    byte myAge = 20;

    // if we don't add the F at the end of the value, Java will give an error to use Double instead
    float myAge = 20.5F;
    double myAge = 20.5;

    String statement = "Hello";

    String is not a primitive. It's an object that is in someway made of up of a number of chars.
    ['H']['E']['L']['L']['O']

Data Types

    variableType variableName = valueThatMatchesType;
    byte myAge = 20;
    String myFirstName = "Jonathan";
    String myLastName = "Ochoa";

    System.out.println(myFirstName);
    System.out.println("Jonathan");

    Output:
    Jonathan


    System.out.print(myAge);

    Output:
    20

    System.out.println("My name is " + myFirstName + " " + myLastName);
    System.out.println("Jonathan Ochoa");

    Output:
    Jonathan Ochoa
